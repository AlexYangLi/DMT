The "dmt-simp-test.txt" file contains the sentences to be predicted, written in simplified characters, each sentence should get either T (Taiwanese) or M (Mainland) label.
Thus, the prediction file to be submitted should contain one label per line, the number of lines is exactly the same as in "dmt-simp-test.txt".
